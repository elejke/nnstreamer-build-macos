# Git pre-commit hook that runs multiple hooks specified in $HOOKS.
# Make sure this script is executable. Bypass hooks with git commit --no-verify.

# This file is inspired by a set of unofficial pre-commit hooks available

# SETTINGS:
# pre-commit hooks to be executed. They should be in the same .git/hooks/ folder
# as this script. Hooks should return 0 if successful and nonzero to cancel the
# commit. They are executed in the order in which they are listed.
