== Gst-Validate

The goal of GstValidate is to be able to detect when elements are not
behaving as expected and report it to the user so he knows how things
are supposed to work inside a GstPipeline. In the end, fixing issues
found by the tool will ensure that all elements behave all together in
the expected way.

The easiest way of using GstValidate is to use one of its command-line
tools, located at tools/ directory. It is also possible to monitor
GstPipelines from any application by using the LD_PRELOAD gstvalidate
lib. The third way of using it is to write your own application that
links and uses libgstvalidate.

== BUILDING

Getting the code:

Releases are available at <URL>, download and extract the tarball. If you
want to use latest git version, do:

git clone <URI>

After cloning or extracting from a tarball, enter the gst-validate directory:

cd gst-validate

Build with:

meson build --prefix=<installation-prefix>
ninja -C build
sudo ninja -C build install (only if you want to install it)

Replace <installation-prefix> with your desired installation path, you can omit
the --prefix argument if you aren't going to install it or if you want the
default /usr/local. It is possible to use gst-validate CLI tools without
installation.
